 * Find the total number of heaps that could be formed with n distinct integers.

 *
 * ***************************** SOLUTION **************************************************
 *
 * To find the total number of heaps that can be formed with
 * ùëõ
 * n distinct integers using a dynamic programming approach,
 * we need to consider the properties of heaps and
 * how they can be recursively broken down into smaller heaps.
 *
 *
 * -------------------Key Concepts-----------------
 *       Heap Properties:--
 *
 * A heap is a complete binary tree where each parent node is greater (for max-heap)
 * or smaller (for min-heap) than its children.
 *
 * Complete Binary Tree:
 *
 * A complete binary tree of n nodes has the first n/2 levels completely filled,
 * and the last level filled from left to right up to n nodes.
 *
 * Recursive Structure of Heaps:
 *
 * The root element must be the largest (for max-heap) or smallest (for min-heap) element.
 * The left and right subtrees must also be heaps.
 *
 * *********  Dynamic Programming Approach *************
 *
 * Count of Heaps:
 *
 * Let dp[n] be the number of distinct heaps that can be formed with n distinct elements.
 *
 * Divide and Conquer:
 *
 * Given the total n elements, the root is fixed.
 * The remaining n‚àí1 elements are divided between the left and right subtrees.
 * The number of elements in the left subtree of a complete binary tree
 * with n nodes can be derived based on the height of the tree.
 *
 *
 * Heap Combination:
 *
 * For each possible split of n‚àí1 elements into the left and right subtrees,
 * the number of heaps is the product of the number of heaps that can be formed with those elements.
 *
 *
 * -------------Steps to Solve------------------
 *
 * Calculate left(n):
 *
 * left(n): Number of nodes in the left subtree of a complete binary tree with n nodes.
 *
 * Dynamic Programming Array:
 *
 * Use a dp array where dp[n] represents the number of distinct heaps
 * that can be formed with n distinct elements.
 *
 * Binomial Coefficient Calculation:
 *
 * Use combinatorics to count the ways to choose the elements for the left subtree from the total n‚àí1 elements.
